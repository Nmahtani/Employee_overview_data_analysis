# Employee overview data analysis
Employee overview ETL using MySQL and PowerBI

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using data related to employee work performance and general information. The main objective is to showcase data extraction from CSV files, transformation using SQL for data cleaning and joining, and visualization in Power BI.

## Project Components
- **Data Extraction**: Two CSV files were created:
  - `employee_work_data.csv` containing daily work data such as work hours, tasks completed, and absences.
  - `employee_info.csv` containing basic employee information, including names and departments.
- **Data Transformation**:
  - Basic and intermediate SQL queries were used to clean and transform the data.
  - Joins were performed to merge employee data with their work performance.
- **Data Loading and Visualization**:
  - Transformed data was imported into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard, allowing for insights into work performance and department trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: To generate CSV data.
- **MySQL**: For data transformation and querying.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and creating dashboards.

## Project Files
- `employee_work_data.csv`: Contains work performance data.
- `employee_info.csv`: Contains basic employee details.
- SQL scripts for data transformation.
- Power BI report file for dashboard visualization.

## How to Run the Project
1. Run the Python script to generate the CSV files.
2. Import the CSV files into MySQL and use the provided SQL scripts for data transformation.
3. Load the cleaned data into Power BI to build and explore the dashboard.

## Summary
This project provides a hands-on demonstration of an ETL process, combining Python, SQL, and Power BI skills to create a complete data analysis workflow.
